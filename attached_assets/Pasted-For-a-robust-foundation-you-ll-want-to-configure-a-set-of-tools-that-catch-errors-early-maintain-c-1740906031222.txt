For a robust foundation, you’ll want to configure a set of tools that catch errors early, maintain code quality, and ensure your model and interface work as intended. Here’s a comprehensive list:
   •   Linting and Formatting:
      •   Pylint or Flake8: Both are excellent for catching stylistic issues, potential errors, and enforcing coding standards.
      •   Black: An uncompromising code formatter that automatically reformats your code to a consistent style.
      •   isort: Automatically sorts your imports, keeping them tidy and making merge conflicts less likely.
      •   mypy: For static type checking—great for catching type mismatches early, especially in larger projects.
   •   Debugging:
      •   pdb or ipdb: Python’s built-in debugger (with ipdb providing a friendlier interface) lets you step through code interactively.
      •   VS Code Debugger: If you’re using VS Code, take advantage of its powerful debugging features with breakpoints, variable inspection, and integrated terminal support.
      •   Streamlit’s Debugging Tools: Streamlit now offers logging and error traceback views—integrate these for your interface to catch issues on the fly.
   •   Testing:
      •   pytest: A flexible testing framework that supports fixtures and parameterized tests. It’s widely used for both unit and integration tests.
      •   unittest: Python’s built-in framework for basic tests (though pytest often provides a more modern and user-friendly approach).
      •   coverage.py: To measure how much of your code is exercised by your tests, ensuring thorough test coverage.
      •   Tox: For running your tests in multiple environments, which is useful if your project depends on various Python versions or dependencies.
   •   Continuous Integration (CI):
      •   GitHub Actions or GitLab CI: Automate your linting, testing, and building processes so that every commit triggers your checks—keeping your repository healthy over time.

Setting these up at the beginning ensures that your code stays clean, errors are caught early, and your automated code generation pipeline is both reliable and production-ready. This not only speeds up development but also builds a solid foundation for scaling and collaboration.
